# WeTheSpeakers

##**UPDATE: WON THE CONGRESSIONAL APP CHALLENGE!!!**

## Inspiration
Hi! My name is Shreeniket, and I am a 15-year-old who loves programming and public speaking. I decided to combine these two passions into a single iOS application, and here is the result! We The Speakers was created due )o my love of public speaking :).

## What it does
We The Speakers has 4 major components. First, it has a tips page where users can learn public speaking and improve their skills. Then, there is a teleprompter feature to record themselves speaking, with a scrolling view. The recorded video is then saved in the users camera roll on their phone. Next, there is a natural language processor used on a speech to analyze how good the user's writing is. Finally, I use the Echo AR SDK to create a NLP virtual microphone.

## How I built it
I used Swift for the iOS app, Echo AR for the augmented reality, and Ruby for the expansion of tips (main page)

## Challenges I ran into
The biggest challenge I ran into would be analyzing the user's inputter speech. It was difficult to get the ML model into my application, and properly analyzing a speech to be positive or negative in emotion. It was also difficult to make the side menu navigation, as I had to make it a collapsable subview in my project, which is a very advanced procedure.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am very proud of getting the speech analysis working so well. It was able to accurately predict the feeling every time I tested it, which is an amazing accomplishment for me (I have never made machine learning by myself). I am also proud of my echo AR implementation, and how well it works! In addition, the teleprompter came out amazing, so I am pretty much proud of the entire project.

## What I learned
I learned the implementation of machine learning, as well as the proper UI design of an app. I also learned how to make a side menu navigation, which turned out very well in the end! I am happy about Dub Hacks, as since I am only a high schooler, I do not get many opportunities to express my interests.

## What's next for We The Speakers
I plan to release this app to the app store and keep working on implementing more and more features. I had an idea of facial emotion recognition in the audience, which would provide insight to the speaker on effectiveness of their presentation.
